Action-adventure sandbox game concept

Designed for Senior Project at SAU. As a result of Covid-19, Tornadoes, and other related issues the project was reduced in size to simply just designing the procedural content generation system.

A procedural content generation system which was to extend not just to the terrain, but also to the point of generating events which would be the points of interaction between NPCs and the player in order to build a story based on choices made at those events.
